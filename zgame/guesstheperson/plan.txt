a game called guess the person.

so theres a main menu you start on, and you can click play or support me on kofi. if they press play it takes them to a screen that asks them to join a game or host a game.
if they choose host a game it should show a load of guess who boards, and its scrollable. it should be pictures that i can choose for the board thumbnail when creating the board. and the board name. and how many characters are in it.
each guess who board should be programmed in a way where its easy for me to add more boards, change pictures, and change names. in a diffrent file.
once they choose a board it should give them a code, and when someone clicks join a game it should ask them for a code, and if they put in the correct code it should take them to the game.

the game
it should say be a big list of characetrs with pictures. on a guess who board like thing. and when you click on one they flip over.
and if you click on a fliped over character they should go back. each player has their own board. 

there should also be a puase button, and when pressed there should be a quit to main menu button, and a more games button.

this should not include that built in browser notifaction thing.


characters will grey out when they are fliped over. and when they turn back they will get their colour back.
